AgroVanguard is a cutting-edge system designed to transform agriculture through advanced predictive analytics. By utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, AgroVanguard aims to optimize crop yields, improve farming practices, and promote sustainable agricultural development.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains datasets used for training and evaluating predictive models.
- **`models/`**: Includes the trained models and scripts for training new models.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction.
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimental work.
- **`config/`**: Configuration files for project settings.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

## Getting Started

To set up AgroVanguard locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AgroVanguard.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd AgroVanguard
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To train the predictive model or make predictions, follow these instructions:

- **To train the model:**
    ```bash
    python src/train_model.py
    ```
- **To make predictions using the trained model:**
    ```bash
    python src/predict.py
    ```

## Output Description

After training, the model will be saved as `saved_model.h5` in the `models/` directory. The `predict.py` script will output predictions, which can be saved to a CSV file or displayed in the console, depending on your implementation.
